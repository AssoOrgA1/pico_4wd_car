Welcome to Pico 4wd car's documentation!
==========================================

Pico-4wd 是一款基于ESP32 RDP的、很酷的、人人都可以拥有的机器人汽车套件。

它配备了灰度传感器模块和超声波模块，可以进行线路跟踪、悬崖探测、跟随和避障功能。组装在汽车底部和尾部的RGB板使它成为黑暗中最酷的精灵。

我们同时提供了基于Python的示例代码，让你可以快速上手。

此外，你还可以使用一个APP —— SunFounder Controller，来DIY你专属的控制方法! Let's Play!
